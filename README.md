Welcome to the python-bootcamp-jomhack-c4 — a tiny code dojo where curious humans and caffeinated keyboards meet to conquer Python one puzzle at a time. This repo collects exercises, solutions, and a healthy dose of chaos from the C4 challenge at Jomhack.

Why this repo exists

- Learn by doing: bite-sized challenges that force you to think, break things, and then fix them.
- Share knowledge: solutions and approaches from the bootcamp so others can learn faster (and make fewer mistakes).
- Have fun: because debugging is just code archaeology with better snacks.

What you’ll find here

- exercises/: Challenge problems and starter code.
- solutions/: Reference solutions and explanations.
- notebooks/: Interactive explorations and demos (if any).
- scripts/: Small utilities used in exercises.

Quick start

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/mobrahi/python-bootcamp-jomhack-c4.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
3. Install requirements (if any):

   pip install -r requirements.txt

How to contribute

- Got a cleaner solution? Open a PR.
- Found a bug in a prompt or test? Open an issue and label it.
- Want to add a challenging puzzle? Submit it under exercises/ with a short README.

Style guide

- Keep functions small and tests smaller.
- Prefer readability over cleverness — cleverness should come with comments.
- Add tests when reasonable; few things are as satisfying as a passing CI badge.
